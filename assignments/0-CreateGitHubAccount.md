# Lesson 0: Create a GitHub Account

`GitHub` is a vital service for every web developer. It is the biggest platform for developers to share and publish code. It relies on a technology called `git` that developers use to manage their versions of the code they are working on. What `git` allows us to do is to keep track of every "saved" version of the code.

An analogy would be like writing an English paper. First you create a rough draft and maybe name the file something like `EnglishEssayRoughDraft1`, then you do some more work on it and decide to name a copy of it `EnglishEssayRoughDraft2`. Now you have two versions of the paper. With `git` we can have multiple versions of our code so that we can make changes without worrying about breaking things - we just revert back to an older version.

This week we will only focus on getting `GitHub` accounts created so that in the future you can push your code to this repo.

## To Do

1. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUuTYDg9XoI) to learn about `git` and `GitHub`.
2. Create a `GitHub` account using your new gmail accounts.
3. Star and Watch this repository.

## Remember

At any point if you are lost or have questions, try to formulate your question into a short sentence and Google it. Learning how to use search engines and popular forums to find the answers you seek is a very valuable skill to have as a developer. The more resourceful and self-reliant you are, the better programmer you will become.
