## Traversymedia - YouTube channel

I really enjoy Brad's content on this [channel](https://www.youtube.com/traversymedia). There's a good mix of tutorial, professional, and crash-course videos for so many relevant web development topics. Here are some of my favorites:

-  [Web Development in 2019 - A Practical Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnTQVlqmDQ0) - The purpose of this video is to list some of the most important things a developer should know, or at least know about in 2019.
